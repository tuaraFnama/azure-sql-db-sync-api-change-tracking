However, if you want to have some more fun with the game, you can also use a program called Cheat Engine to modify some aspects of the game, such as your health, ammo, inventory, and more. Cheat Engine is a free software that allows you to scan and change the values of any process running on your computer. You can use it to hack almost any game or application, as long as you know what you are doing.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Cheat Engine to hack Splinter Cell on PC. You will need the following things:
 
- A PC with Windows OS
- The game Splinter Cell installed on your PC (we are using the 3CD version with English language)
- The program Cheat Engine installed on your PC (you can download it from [here](https://www.cheatengine.org/))
- A basic knowledge of how to use Cheat Engine (you can check out some tutorials [here](https://www.cheatengine.org/tutorials.php))

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Launch the game Splinter Cell and start a new game or load an existing one.
2. Launch Cheat Engine and click on the "Select a process to open" button (the computer icon on the top left corner).
3. Find and select the process named "SplinterCell.exe" and click "Open".
4. In Cheat Engine, click on the "Add Address Manually" button (the green plus icon on the top right corner).
5. Type in the following address: 005A0F40. This is the address that stores your health value in the game.
6. Click "OK". You should see a new entry in the address list with the value 100.
7. Change the value to any number you want, such as 9999. This will give you unlimited health in the game.

You can repeat this process for other values in the game, such as ammo, inventory items, etc. You just need to find the correct addresses for them. You can use the "Scan" function in Cheat Engine to search for them. For example, if you want to find the address for your pistol ammo, you can do this:

1. In Cheat Engine, click on the "New Scan" button (the magnifying glass icon on the top left corner).
2. Type in the current amount of pistol ammo you have in the game (for example, 20) and click "First Scan".
3. In the game, fire your pistol once and check how much ammo you have left (for example, 19).
4. In Cheat Engine, type in the new amount of pistol ammo you have in the game (for example, 19) and click "Next Scan".
5. You should see one or a few addresses in the address list that match your ammo value.
6. Select one of them and click on the "Add Address Manually" button.
7. Type in a name for the address (for example, "Pistol Ammo") and click "OK".
8. Change the value to any number you want, such as 999. This will give you unlimited pistol ammo in the game.
